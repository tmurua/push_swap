## sorting_algorithm.c
1. Research which algorithm or algorithms would be best (easy to read, easy to write, sorts number within limits, i.e. sort 100 random numbers in fewer than 700 operations)
	- turk algorithm seems a good option
	- using different algorithms for stack with less than 5 numbers and more than 5 numbers also seems a good idea
2. implementation must input the structs t_stack_a and t_stack_b and output the sorting_operations
